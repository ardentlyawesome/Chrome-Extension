# Chrome Extension

A chrome extension I made while following a tutorial. 
To get it to work, you download it and add it to your chrome extension library [developer mode and load an unpacked package]. 

It works as a link collector of sorts, you can spam links and save them, this implements Chrome's Local Storage among other things.
